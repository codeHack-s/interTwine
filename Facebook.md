                                       THE MAIN REQUIREMENTS IN FACEBOOK GRAPH API 
To use the Facebook Graph API, you will need to meet the following requirements:

1. Facebook Developer Account: You must have a Facebook Developer account to create and manage Facebook apps. You can sign up for a Developer account at: https://developers.facebook.com/

2. App Creation: You must create a Facebook app and obtain an App ID and App Secret. These credentials are used to authenticate your app and make API requests on behalf of your app.

3. App Permissions: You will need to request the necessary permissions from Facebook users to access their data or perform actions on their behalf. The permissions you request must be approved by Facebook and comply with Facebook's policies.

4. Access Tokens: To make API requests, you will need an access token that is issued by Facebook. There are different types of access tokens depending on the type of request you are making and the level of permissions required.

5. API Endpoints: You will need to know the specific API endpoints and parameters required to make the desired request. These are documented in the Facebook Graph API documentation.

6. API Limits: Facebook imposes limits on the number and frequency of API requests that can be made. You should be aware of these limits and design your app accordingly to avoid exceeding them.

7. Compliance with Facebook Policies: You must comply with Facebook's Platform Policy and Developer Policies when using the Graph API. Failure to comply with these policies can result in your app being suspended or terminated.
